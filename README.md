# CHICHIMON
christmas project for my girlfriend

I designed and and created using pixel art the characters, 'pokemon', map tiles, and map layout in addition to coding the mechanics (some I created on my own and some I had to learn online for)

# how to play

MOVEMENT
- 'up' arrow
- 'down' arrow
- 'left' arrow
- 'right' arrow

BATTLE
- 'space' to proceed
- 'left' and 'right' arrow to select move

DIALOGUE
- 'space' to proceed unless prompted otherwise

GAMEPLAY TIP
- damage for both enemy and player is randomized, but the max damage for enemy is higher.
- user can 'attack' or 'heal'
- both user and enemy can roll a 'critical attack' which does extra damage
- user can roll a 'critical heal'
- user may out-heal enemy attack by random chance, increasing survivability
